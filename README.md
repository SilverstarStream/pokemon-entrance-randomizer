# Info

This randomizer fork implements several entrance randomization settings on top of Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX.

Currently only Pokemon Platinum (U) is supported. Other (U) games are planned to be supported in the future.

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/SilverstarStream/pokemon-entrance-randomizer/releases) for changelogs and downloads.

# Known Issues
- (Platinum, Gym Shuffler) Hearthome (Fantinaâ€™s) Gym has a darkness effect that is removed once Fantina is beaten. If Hearthome Gym is shuffled to be after Hearthome City, the darkness effect will not be present while challenging the gym. I can confirm that the game specifically checks for badge number 4 (0-based) for this effect, and I am almost certain the effect is not controlled by scripts.


- (Platinum, Gym Shuffler) After each gym leader is beaten, they have some dialogue for the player. This dialogue is edited to properly reflect the name of the badge given to the player and the name of the HM that becomes usable. Depending on which dialogue gets which badge and HM, the text can exceed the width of the text box. This shouldn't cause crashes, but the ends of lines can be cut off.


- (Platinum, Map Randomizer) Cheryl's Chansey doesn't scale to Eterna Forest's placement.

# Other problems

If you have problems using the randomizer, it could be because of some problem with Java or your operating system. **If you have problems with starting the randomizer specifically, [read this page first before creating an issue.](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/About-Java)** If that page does not solve your problem, submit an issue using the `Need Help` issue template.

## Special Thanks

Spiky-Eared Pichu for SDSME. The program itself helped me understand how Platinum handles most everything related to maps, warps, and scripts, and its source code contained most everything I needed to know to develop my randomizer settings.

Ajarmar and tom-overton for initial feedback to these settings and advice.
